# Github University: A Language-Agnostic Automated Grading Solution

## 1.Overview
As the university-wide demand for courses requiring computer programming continues to spike, courses have struggled to meet the infrastructural demands of grading student code. Hand-grading student code does not scale to courses of large sizes, and existing automated grading tools often cannot be easily configured to meet the demands of individual courses relying on vastly different programming languages and toolsets. To solve, we present Github University, a modular, scalable, and secure code grading platform that that leverages Github Actions to automate all parts of the grading process, including pre-grading checks and grade book compilation. Github University can be easily configured for any course regardless of programming language and libraries of choice, and runs student code in a containerized environment to guarantee security and consistency. Github Actions is currently deployed in multiple courses containing more than 500 students total, and we recommend its general adoption for courses requiring autograding.
